## About
I am creating this MMORPG-inspired text-based idle game as something for my viewers to play while I am streaming.
I have not yet decided on a name, but it will probably be sci-fi-themed.
Currently it is heavily tied to Twitch integration, and that is the primary way I plan to monetize it.
I am planning to also make it playable through other chat clients such as Discord,
but in-game benefits will probably still only be unlockable through Twitch.

## Why open-source?
Ultimately, I am creating this game for my own benefit, and no one else's.
However, as I am planning to monetize it as a service, and not a stand-alone application,
I have no reason to keep the source code secret, and I am happy to contribute to the Open Source community if I can.
This does not mean that I am planning to accept any contributions or make extraneous efforts to keep it modular or extensible or well-documented.
Feel free to fork it and use it pursuant to the EUPL, but pull requests will only be merged if I happen to really like the contribution. 

Currently my intention is to allow you to monetize your own deployment of the game server on your own platform however you wish,
but my own deployment on a server I control will only incentivize players to subscribe to and cheer in my own Twitch channel.
I might in the future allow you to add my client bot to your channel, but doing so would only benefit me.
If you modify the source code for deployment on your own server, you still need to release the code compliant with the EUPL,
document your changes, and credit me as the original developer.

I chose the EUPL primarily because it allows you more flexibility in licensing derivative works than similar licenses like the AGPL or OSL,
while still requiring preservation of the open-source nature of the software
even if you are providing access to it as an online service rather than a copy of the program.
